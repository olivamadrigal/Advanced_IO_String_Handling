Advanced String Handling and Advanced I/O in C


1. A variation of Project 3, page 163: from John Perry's Book on Advancec C Programming

Requirements:
a. Display the maximum line number in the file.
b. Outputted lines must have LINE NUMBERS to the left of the line text. Allot a fixed
field width of FIVE for those line numbers.
c. A reminder about creating your OFFSETS array -- since you do not know how big
to make this array, start with 1000 and use realloc() to make the array bigger as
needed.
d. Create two source files and a header file
e. Define and use at least 5 functions (6 if you count main()).
f. Write main() as a test driver (i.e. write a loop in main(), as shown in other book
examples).
